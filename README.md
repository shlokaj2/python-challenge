# python-challenge

I have the codes for both the PyBank assignment and PyPoll assignment. However, I don't know how well it works. I have been working on it and have used all my resources to the best of my ability. Unfortunately, my internet has been poor the last couple of days and keeps coming and going. This made it hard to work on the assignment as I was not able to get the proper help I needed on the assignment, without proper internet. I have submitted what I have so far and will resubmit it at a later time.
